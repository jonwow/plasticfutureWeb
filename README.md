# PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS AND NOT LAUNCHED YET. THESE ARE THE DEMO FILES.

<p>This free project started in February 2020 (main repository was deleted) and was postponed in December 2020 due to another project (<a href="https://red-room.lt/en">red-room.lt</a>) that was more important as this project has no deadline. Created by <a href="https://github.com/jonwow">jonwow</a>, designed by <a href="https://github.com/jonwow">jonwow</a> & <a href="https://github.com/OlimpoVaikas">OlimpoVaikas</a>.</p>

<h1>React, JavaScript ES6+, CSS & HTML, CORS, MongoDB & Mongoose, Express</h1>

<ul>
  <strong>Key points and notes:</strong>
  <li>Currently in progress, but so far it works flawlessly with the MERN stack.</li>
  <li>Automatically selects a size if only one size is present. If no sizes are present - products are grayscaled and blurred and displayed as unavailable.</li>
<li>The client asked that most pictures would remain uncompressed because it's a design oriented page and it is already fast.</li>
  <li>Filtering and sorting functions are programmed and will soon be implemented in the UI.</li>
  <li>ES6+ - arrow functions, classes, spread operator (...), const/let instead of var for better scoping and stability, Object.values.</li>
  <li>Fully responsive (tested on all devices).</li>
  <li>Some files have have been removed for privacy and security reasons.</li>
  <li>Tested & working without any flaws on all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Firefox Developer's Edition.</li>
</ul>
