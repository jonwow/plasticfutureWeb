not important:
#052020/1 - small window zoomed in a lot: text in the header 'plastic future' gets lowered. probably because of the translationXY and font-size 11vmin
#060120/2 - 1111x9999 & 700x9200 resolution header. fixable by creating additional media queries and changing heights to vmin
#??????/1 - when the scrollbar appears the page changes dimensions/moves, perhaps it doesn't affect the three lines (nicce header doesn't bug, perhaps compare the code)
#060820/1 - fonts load too slow.



GENERAL BUGS:
#050520/1 - edge does not  support width fit-content and the header bugs when scrolling.
#061120/1 - go-to-top button only changes opacity and does not disappear. adding a 'display: none' makes the transition disappear.

STYLE BUGS:


FIXED:
#051420/1 - mozilla small window shows weird height for products.
(Jonas) fixed before.

#??????/2 - large phones have extra space in the right (grid sizings). 
(Jonas) fixed before.

#??????/1 - 1366x768 or smaller 200% zoom in has bad spacing. 
(Jonas) fixed before.

#??????/3 - ~1280x720 max zoom makes the font too big on the footer newsletter. 
(Jonas) fixed before.

#??????/4 - ~1280x720 screen: the spacing of pricetags when 500% zoom is turned on gets too big.
2020-(Jonas) fixed before.

#060120/1 - iphone xr widescreen shows sticky footer above the real footer.
2020-06-04 (Jonas): moved the 'real' footer below the sticky footer and that solved the problem.
